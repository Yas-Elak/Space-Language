About the game :
Learn French while you destroy monsters with one of your spaceships.
Learn French by themes (body, verbs, family, colors, jobs, food, ...) 
Earn points and buy new spaceships and monster to fight.

Every time you get a good answer you destroy the monster, then he come back a little it quicker 
and you have to guess the next word before he hit your spaceship.

I made the game with libgdx as an exercise for my bachelor degree in Business Informatics.
Now I would probably use Unity but it was intersting to develop this little game without the GUI of unity.
